# The Banned Book Project Front End
Started as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegreee and developed furthered after doing the Udacity full-stack Nanodegree.

Throughout history, various regimes have banned books primarily (but not limited to) political reasons. Particularly in today's climate, it is vital to understand how information and ideas have historically been exchanged and suppressed.

On this front end to the end goal is to enable the adding, editing and removal of books to create and update repository; as well as to showcase an easy to navigate and seamless UI.
